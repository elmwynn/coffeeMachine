# coffeeMachine
A very, very, simple first Python program just to familiarize myself with Python syntax and semantics.
Users can get a coffee machine to make different types of coffee. Coffee objects have different attributes that are
deducted from the resources of the machine. Users can print a coffee machine report with "report" and turn it off
with "off" at the first prompt.
